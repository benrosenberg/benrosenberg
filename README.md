## Top projects
 - [StackTo](https://github.com/benrosenberg/stackto): programming language that uses [GOTO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto) statements for control flow and [RPN](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) for expression evaluation.
 - [Truth table generator](https://github.com/benrosenberg/truth-table-generator): truth table generator written in Python. Uses Shunting-Yard algorithm to parse logical expressions with `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `EQUALS`, and `IMPLIES` operators, and parentheses.
 - [bots.benrosenberg.info](https://bots.benrosenberg.info): guide to and reference for Discord bots I've created
 - [leetcode.benrosenberg.info](https://leetcode.benrosenberg.info): frontend for a selection of LeetCode solutions
 - [storagesite](https://github.com/benrosenberg/storagesite): proof-of-concept file upload site with math captchas created with Flask, nginx, Gunicorn, SQLite, S3, a DigitalOcean droplet, and elbow grease
 - [durtle](https://github.com/benrosenberg/durtle): small [turtle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics)-centric programming language made with the [Pegged](https://github.com/dlang-community/Pegged) parsing expression grammar library for [D](https://dlang.org/), and using [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) (via [raylib-d](https://code.dlang.org/packages/raylib-d)) for graphics
